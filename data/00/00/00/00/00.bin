  |   Pok‚mon if you use them as soon as a battle begins.                   |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Codes will be distributed between November 15, 2019 and January 15,   |

  |   Begin your adventure as a Pok‚mon Trainer by choosing one of three    |
  |   new partner Pok‚mon: Grookey, Scorbunny, or Sobble. Then embark on    |
  |   a journey in the new Galar region, where you'll challenge the         |
  |   troublemakers of Team Yell, while unraveling the mystery behind the   |
  |   Legendary Pok‚mon Zacian and Zamazenta! Explore the Wild Area, a      |
  |   vast expanse of land where the player can freely control the          |
  |   camera. Team up with three other players locally or online in the     |
  |   new multiplayer co-op Max Raid Battles in which players will face     |
  |   off against gigantic and super-strong Pok‚mon known as Dynamax        |
  |   Pok‚mon.                                                              |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Certain Pok‚mon can even Gigantamax to gain a new look and a          |
  |   powerful set of G-Max moves. But there's more to being a champion     |
  |   than honing your battle skills: you can pick your own clothes and     |
  |   get a new hairdo while visiting the stores in town, so you can be     |
  |   the Trainer you want to be. Throughout your journey, you'll           |
  |   encounter newly discovered Pok‚mon as well as familiar ones that      |
  |   will look a little different in their new Galarian forms! And for     |
  |   another way to level up your Pok‚mon, assign them Pok‚ Jobs to        |
  |   complete. You can even play with your Pok‚mon in Pok‚mon Camp, just   |
  |   for fun!                                                              |
